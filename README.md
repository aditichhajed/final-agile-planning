## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, (Problem statement given - we develop a product catalog for an e-commerce website. This includes essential CRUD operations for products, features like product liking, cloud hosting, and automated deployments.) <br>
Expected Outcome - **To manage the project through Agile practices using GitHub Projects and Kanban board.**

---

## üìÖ Project Workflow

We follow Agile methodologies to organize and execute tasks. Here's a high-level view of the process:

1. **Create Repository & Project**:
   - Repository: [final-agile-planning](https://github.com/aditichhajed/final-agile-planning)
   - Project: [Final Project Kanban Board]

2. **Define User Stories**:
   - **Create a Product**: As a user, I need to create a product so that it can be added to the catalog.
   - **Retrieve a Product**: As a user, I need to retrieve a product so that I can view its details.
   - **Update a Product**: As a user, I need to update a product so that I can modify its details.
   - **Delete a Product**: As a user, I need to delete a product so that it can be removed from the catalog.
   - **Like a Product**: As a user, I need to like a product so that it can show my preference.
   - **Dislike a Product**: As a user, I need to dislike a product so that it can show my disinterest.
   - **List All Products**: As a user, I need to list all products so that I can view the catalog.
   - **Query Products**: As a user, I need to query a subset of products so that I can find specific items.
   - **Cloud Hosting**: As a user, I need the catalog hosted in the cloud so that it‚Äôs accessible globally.
   - **Automated Deployment**: As a user, I need automated deployments so that changes are reflected without manual intervention.

3. **Organize Issues**:
   - Move **List All Products** and **Query Products** to the Icebox.
   - Move the rest to the Product Backlog.

4. **Backlog Refinement**:
   - Rank stories based on priority.
   - Update top 5 stories with acceptance criteria using Gherkin syntax.

5. **Labels**:
   - Add `enhancement` or `technical debt` labels to all stories.

6. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Create a 2-week sprint milestone named **Sprint**.
   - Move top 4 stories to Sprint Backlog with story points.

## üîÑ Kanban Workflow

My project workflow follows Agile practices using a Kanban board. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to our Kanban workflow:

### 1. Sprint Planning

1. **Select Stories**:
   - Choose the top 4 user stories from the Product Backlog.
   - Assign them to the current sprint milestone named **Sprint**.

2. **Estimate Story Points**:
   - Assign story points to each selected story based on complexity.

3. **Move to Sprint Backlog**:
   - Move these stories from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog.

### 2. Execute Sprint

1. **Start Work**:
   - Assign the top story to yourself.
   - Move the story from Sprint Backlog to **In Progress**.

2. **Progress the Story**:
   - Work on the story until it is ready for review.
   - Move the story from **In Progress** to **Review/QA**.

3. **Review and Complete**:
   - After review, move the story to **Done**.
   - Take the next story from the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to **In Progress**.

4. **Repeat Steps**:
   - Continue the process until the sprint ends.

### 3. Track Progress

- **Burndown Chart**: Monitor the burndown chart to track the sprint's progress and ensure that tasks are on track for completion.

## üìä Burndown Chart

The burndown chart is an essential tool for tracking the progress of our sprint. It shows the remaining work versus the time available.

1. **Setup**:
   - Use GitHub‚Äôs in-built charting for detailed analytics.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check the chart regularly to ensure the team is on track.
   - Adjust workload if necessary to meet sprint goals.
